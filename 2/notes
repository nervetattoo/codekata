Iteratively slicing the array leaves you with a reindexed array by default as it is positional indexed
This makes it hard to return the initial position.

Two strategies:
    1: Maintain an offset counter that can be used to pad the end result
        Turned out to be a real pain
    2: Dont reindex arrays (how?)
        Voila, php has this as a param to array_slice() - new knowledge!

Time spent: 2 hours - harder than suspected

My initial plan was to iteratively cut down the initial array into a 50% sized
That proved to be the final solution as well, but it took about 5 iterations to reach the final solution
